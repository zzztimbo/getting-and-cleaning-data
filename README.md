##### run_analysis.R


The `run_analysis.R` script takes raw accelerometer data from [Human Activity
Recognition Using Smartphones Data
Set](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones),
provided by the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository, and generates summary
statistics. The final output file is named
`sensor_means_and_std_grouped_by_activity_and_subject.txt`.  


##### CodeBook.md

The `CodeBook.md` Markdown file describes the   variables, the data, and any
transformations or work that was performed to clean up the raw accelerometer
data.
